# DiscoGift

> DiscoGift is now released and it allows for injections of Discord Nitro into a users Discord Account ðŸ‘€

DiscoGift is a lightweight program used for communicating with the server responsible for the **cranberry** method used in [Blossom](https://github.com/XplosiON1232/Blossom) to inject Discord Nitro into a users Discord account. The *cranberry* program is one of many methods used in Cherry Blossom to credit Discord Nitro to a specific users account.

**Discord Nitro Prices using <u>cranberry</u>**
- <u>Nitro ($10)</u>
	- *Monthly:* **$4.99**
	- *Yearly:* **$29.99**
- <u>Nitro Basic ($3)</u>
	- *Monthly:* **$1.99**
	- *Yearly:* **$19.99**

> Once Blossom is publicly released, there will be a bunch of features available there, and Discogift will probably be useless. You can find the official Blossom github page [here](https://github.com/XplosiON1232/Blossom). For now, enjoy Discogift.
